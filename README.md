    - Ex - if Gross Annual Income + Extra Income - Deductions =  6 Lakhs, no tax
    - if Gross Annual Income + Extra Income - Deductions =  9 Lakhs, tax
- Income over 8 (>) Lakhs, the amount over 8 Lakhs is taxed at
    - 30% for people with age < 40
    - 40% for people with age ≥ 40 but < 60
    - 10% for people with age ≥ 60
